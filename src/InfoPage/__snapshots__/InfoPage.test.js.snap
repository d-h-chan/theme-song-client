    2. From the 'Search' Page, search through songs you saved by keyword. Leaving the input blank will return all saved songs, and searching with an input will return all songs with either a matching lyric or keyword

    Example: to make the song "Set a Fire" available for search, go to the 'Add' page, search for "Set a Fire" in 'Open Search', checkbox the song and click 'Add to database'. It will then be available from the 'Search' page if you input any lyric or label you saved ("fire", "soul", "love", etc)

    Notes
  </h2>
  <p>
    * Use of this tool requires internet connection, both to search through saved songs and to add songs from them Genius API
  </p>
  <p>
    * If a song is already in the database, saving it again will not update the labels
  </p>
  <p>
    * The only way to add a new artist to database is to save a song by that artist (limited by how the genius api works)
